INFO:Xst:2117 - HDL ADVISOR - Mux Selector <state> of Case statement line 242 was re-encoded using one-hot encoding. The case statement will be optimized (default statement optimization), but this optimization may lead to design initialization problems. To ensure the design works safely, you can:
   	- add an 'INIT' attribute on signal <state> (optimization is then done without any risk)
   	- use the attribute 'signal_encoding user' to avoid onehot optimization
   	- use the attribute 'safe_implementation yes' to force XST to perform a safe (but less efficient) optimization

WARNING:Xst:737 - Found 8-bit latch for signal <data_bus>. Latches may be generated from incomplete case or if statements. We do not recommend the use of latches in FPGA/CPLD designs, as they may lead to timing problems.
INFO:Xst:2371 - HDL ADVISOR - Logic functions respectively driving the data and gate enable inputs of this latch share common terms. This situation will potentially lead to setup/hold violations and, as a result, to simulation problems. This situation may come from an incomplete case statement (all selector values are not covered). You should carefully review if it was in your intentions to describe such a latch.
