The case statement will be optimized (default statement optimization), but this optimization may lead to design initialization problems. To ensure the design works safely, you can:
	- add an &apos;<arg fmt="%s" index="3">INIT</arg>&apos; attribute on signal &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="4">state</arg>&gt; (optimization is then done without any risk)
